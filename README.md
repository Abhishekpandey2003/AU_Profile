# AU_Profile
Overview:
I am currently enrolled in an intensive Data Scientist training program at AU Skill Academy. This program is designed to equip me with practical and theoretical knowledge in data science, analytics, and machine learning, with a strong focus on hands-on projects and real-world applications. The training covers a wide range of data science topics, from foundational concepts to advanced techniques. Through interactive sessions, practical labs, and guided projects, I am gaining the necessary skills to become proficient in analyzing and interpreting complex datasets.

Key Learning Outcomes:
Mastering core data science concepts such as data wrangling, data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning.
Gaining proficiency in programming languages and tools, including Python, SQL, and popular data science libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn).
Developing skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
Working with real-world datasets to build predictive models, including regression, classification, and clustering.

Tools and Technologies:
Python, SQL
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
Git, GitHub for version control
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

Future Plans:
I plan to leverage the skills acquired from this training to work on more advanced machine learning projects and further my career in data science and AI.
Feel free to explore my projects and contributions on GitHub!
